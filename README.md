# Getting Started with Programming languages

First question which always arises in everybody minds is that "Why do we need any Programming Language for?"

As I've understood from my point of view, any of the Programming languages for a Computer out there in the world is just like what our Soul is to our Physical Body.

In today's world, communicating with a Computer involves speaking the language the Computer understands, which immediately rules out English as the primary language of communication with the Computer. In simple language, we can say that English( the mothertongue of a computer) is just like our mothertongue language "Hindi" in which we can understand anything which we're unable to understand in any other language. Mothertongue Languages may differ acc. to the region where any person is living or acc. to a person's communicating language.
